### ðŸ”® Future-Proof Feature Ideas

### Live add to cart count that creates urgency.

- The key to having people take action is to give them a reason. By showing them how many spots are available, or how many are currently vieweing the product on stripe, they are more likely going to want to take action and move closer to their goals. It creates a sense of urgency! This metric can also be used to show data to the marketers on their dashboard.

## Smart follow-ups for attendees who didnâ€™t convert.

- After the attendees has hoped on a sales call with the AI agent, you need to follow up with customers if they don't convert. Use resend to send emails / follow up sequences to customers. This is huge for marketers! You can also take on the email costs (skool does this too).

## Niche specific template agents

- Vapi has many template agents but they arent taylored to perform the way you like. Create a few templates that are niche specific that can help marketers start today! for example, instead of Sales agent, call it Sales agents for fitness coaches selling programs between $2k - $15k. This makes your product feel more unique and you'll stand out.

## Real time sound notifications when attendees pay

- Using dopamine to create stickiness is awesome! When you trigger visual or auditory feedback for customersr (it has to sound nice, not alarming), it gets them to want more. Skool does this, and they do it really well! When a customer comes through it makes a cash register noise that gets people excited. It's also a fun way to market your SAAS.

## Webinar explore page (Not tested)

- You can create an explore page for attendees to search and find what they're looking for. If you have good enough SEO and traffic, other marketers will see good traffic and signups.

## Gamify the process

- Create rewards, leaderboard, or the highest revenue generating webinar and offer monetary incentives, or free educational / inperson experiences to keep people motivated to stay longer.
